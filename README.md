#### commandments
  - If can be written in Javascript, it will end written in Javascript.
  - I will not include any blocking scripts.
  - I will use SVGs instead of JPGs, wherever possible.
  - I will not include ads for my own stuff.
  - I will not include third party JavaScript libraries just to detect if users are part of my “Just Cool Friends” Facebook group, even if it wouldn’t take up that much extra load time.
  - I will not use translate3d as a hack.
  - I will use a CDN to serve static content (with no cookies!).
  - I will minify all of my CSS.
